## A few words about myself.
I am interested in EVERYTHING in the world. I realy want to know and understand whatever I can imagine.  I like to study so muth. Today I want to be an IT-ingereer, not just a programmer or tester. I want to go deep through this.

## Skils.

Code examples are on github or codewars

First of all I do katas on codewars to get practice

## About my English.
I learned English myself from 0. I can read almost everithing exept headings of *The New York Times* :see_no_evil:  
I do not have any speaking practice unfortunately, but I like to watch cartoons (*Pepa Pig* or *Fixies*) and TAD talks. It helps me a lot.
